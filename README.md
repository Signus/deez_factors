# Deez Factors
Looks for people in the GitHub organization that do not have 2-factor
authentication turned on. Now you can tell your users to `Get Deez Factors!`

## How to set it up
You need to set an environment variable, `GITHUB_API_KEY`, either in your
shell or by adding it to a file called `.env` in the format `GITHUB_API_KEY:blahblah`.
The token I used was a GitHub Personal Access Token. Then you just run the program.
